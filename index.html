                                self-control. At the age of 17 years old, Nyene had his first shoot out and by 20 he
                                caught his first adult record selling drugs. By 26, he had already experienced 4
                                attempts on his life, and at age 30, he was arrested by the FBI and sentenced to 180

                                Program was formed because every person deserves the chance to learn from mistakes
                                without enduring the same consequences. By teaching self-control and conflict

                                with Latino Spirit Media, made history on Friday, May 31, 2024. They brought together 55
                                students and 13 chaperones for a transformative experience at the Google headquarters in
                                New York City, participating in the New York City Summer Jam BreakBeatCode Hackathon.
                                Held at Google's prestigious location at 335 West Houston St., this event marked a
                                significant milestone for all involved.</div>
                            <div class="ha3">As the Founder and CEO of Visionary Philanthropy Group Inc., Nyene Baker,
                                along
                                with Visionary Philanthropy Group's Executive Assistant, Kadine Shirley, worked
                                tirelessly to ensure the success of this event. They stayed up until 1 AM handling
                                Google waivers, sending reminders, and organizing the trip to make sure everyone was
                                included. Baker, exemplifying dedication, woke up at 4:30 AM to be at the pick-up
                                location by 5:30 AM and even drove an extra Mercedes Sprinter 15-passenger van in
                                addition to the chartered 54-passenger bus. His commitment, along with the efforts of
                                the VPG team, Latino Spirit Media, and the Executive Director/Founder Diego Maya was
                                instrumental in making this event a reality.</div>

                                Inc., played a crucial role in the success of this trip. As an intern, facilitator, and
                                volunteer for VPG, she assisted with recruitment, back office tasks, and chaperoning,
                                alongside her daughter Dyon Patterson. Israel Martin, the Founder and CEO of Redefining
                                The Youth, also volunteer and facilitator of VPG assisted in bringing a group of young

                                Club, including her wonderful daughter Blessyn Walker. Teri Moore from the Federal

                            <div class="ha3">Baker expressed immense gratitude to Freddie Rosado, the owner of
                                McDonald's at 501 Chambers St., in Trenton NJ and his staff for coming in early to help
                                prepare the breakfast, sponsor the breakfast, that helped set a positive tone for the
                                day. The chartered bus and van were filled to capacity, a sight Baker described as a
                                "Dream Come True from God."</div>
                            <div class="ha3">The Hackathon itself was a remarkable event, livestreamed globally with
                                special guest Supernatural, the legendary freestyle hip hop artist, and DJ Siege
                                providing music. The event began with Dale Allsopp, Director of Google Ads
                                Responsibility Office, inspiring the crowd to believe in their dreams. He aslo talked
                                about how Supernatural ended his rap career. Richard Achee, Head of Infrastructure
                                Partnerships/Privacy Sandbox at Google and creator of BreakBeatCode, captivated the
                                students by teaching them how to create music with code using Earsketch. In less than
                                two hours, the students learned Python coding, music production, and the functions of a
                                code editor/digital audio workstation, creating their own beats and becoming artist
                                engineers.</div>

                            <div class="ha3">After lunch, Aaron Wade, a young African-American Creative Technologist at
                                Google, shared his experience working with Lupe Fiasco on Gen AI for rappers and
                                songwriters, inspiring the students with his story because they had the opportunity to
                                see a young man of color who partnered with a star rapper to create a AI platform. The
                                highlight of the day was Supernatural, who freestyled over beats made by the students,
                                turning the event into a lively and interactive session. His 30-minute plus freestyle,
                                where he incorporated items from the audience into his rap, left everyone in awe.</div>
                            <div class="ha3">The event concluded with a Q&A session, where Baker felt immense pride as
                                his young ladies from various programs confidently asked questions. A particularly
                                memorable moment was when nine-year-old Parker Stephens asked Supernatural about his
                                favorite book, prompting Supernatural to share one of his favorites. This interaction
                                underscored the importance of curiosity and learning, a sentiment that resonates deeply
                                with Baker, who asked his mentor Michael Harry-O Harris the Founder of Death Row Records
                                while in Federal Prison what was his top 5 books after that question Harris introduced
                                Baker into Philanthropy,Baker came up with his nonprofit name,and the rest is history.

                            <div class="ha3">Overall, the Google NYC trip was a life-changing experience for many,
                                making a significant impact on all attendees. The event was a resounding success,
                                attended by 300 students on-site and over 3,000 students online from more than 37
                                countries. Visionary Philanthropy Group Inc. and Latino Spirit Media are profoundly
                                grateful for the opportunity to partner with BreakBeatCode and reach such a broad
                                audience that gives them exposure in over 37 countries. They extend their heartfelt
                                thanks to all donors, sponsors, students, parents, chaperones, friends, organizations,
